        <p class="mb-4">Each presenter will be given a time slot of 15 minutes in total, which is distributed as 10 minutes of presentation and 5 minutes of answering questions from the auditorium and changing of presenters at the podium. As the schedule of presentation sessions is tight it is of utmost importance that all presenters are ready and in time for their presentations. The introduction of each presenter will be kept brief when introduced by the moderator. In order for the audience to move between sessions we will keep the schedule starting time for each presentation even if the previous author do not require the full 15 minutes allowed.</p>
